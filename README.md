Week 0
I wanted to start summarizing some of the information I am learning as I make my way through this course.  I am very much looking forward to working through CS50.  The first week's lectures were a bit of a refresher for a couple of topics for me as I am not a complete beginner to computer science.  The explanation on binary was very interesting.  Binary is a topic that I am interested in, But never expect to truly learn.  This week also saw the introduction to the scratch programming language.  It is interesting how the capability to create things is becoming less and less dependant on learning a complex programming language.  The teacher also introduced several projects that past students have worked on.  This has given me several ideas of projects to undertake.  I am hoping to do the more advanced problem sets as the course progresses.  The teacher is very entertaining and does an excellent job of introducing new concepts.  Looking forward to week 1.
